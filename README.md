# Assignments from AMATH 482 - Computational Methods for Data Analysis

This is a repository of all the assignments I completed for AMATH 482. This course taught and explored data analysis methods for a variety of applications.

## Assignments:
### Homework 1
The first assignment focused on using fourier transforms. Given a noisy ultrasound signal of a moving object, the frequency of the object had to first be found. Then, to find the location of the object at each point in time, a filter was applied in the frequency domain, centered around the frequency of the object.

### Homework 2
The second assignment delve into time-frequency analysis using Gabor transforms to create spectrograms. The effect of different parameters of the Gabor transform, such as window width, sampling amount, and translation distance, on the resulting spectrogram was investigated in the first part of the assignment. In the second part, the differences between the spectrograms of two musical instruments were investigated. Time-frequency analysis was also used to determine the exact notes and rhythm of the music being played by the instruments.

### Homework 3
The third assignment
